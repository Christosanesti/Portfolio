Hello! I'm a passionate Junior Web Developer with a knack for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. My journey in web development has led me to explore and master cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js and React.js, which are the cornerstones of my development stack.

I'm also deeply fascinated by the decentralized web and have dedicated time to understanding and developing on Web3 platforms. My proficiency extends to writing smart contracts in Solidity, enabling me to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem meaningfully.

As a developer who loves challenges, I regularly sharpen my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, pushing the boundaries of my coding abilities. I'm eager to bring my blend of development skills and enthusiasm for new technologies to a team that values innovation and forward-thinking.

Let's build the future of the web, one line of code at a time!
      </motion.p>

      <div className='mt-20 flex flex-wrap gap-10'>
        {services.map((service, index) => (
          <ServiceCard key={service.title} index={index} {...service} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default SectionWrapper(About, "about");
